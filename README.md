This is my Homelab's Kubernetes cluster. All workloads are in the [deployments](./deployments/) folder and sorted into folders by namespace. Investigate into each folder below to learn more about my deployments. This repository isn't really a tutorial on how to set up a cluster because of the amount of differences you would experience in setting up a Kubernetes cluster. However I do have some things documented in the [docs](./docs/) folder. You can also checkout my [k3s-gitops-arm](https://github.com/onedr0p/k3s-gitops-arm) repo for more of a A-Z guide on how to setup a cluster on a bunch of Raspberry Pis.

## Deployment Namespaces

- [cert-manager](./deployments/cert-manager)
- [default](./deployments/default)
- [flux](./deployments/flux)
- [kube-system](./deployments/kube-system)
- [logging](./deployments/logging)
- [monitoring](./deployments/monitoring)
- [rook-ceph](./deployments/rook-ceph)
- [velero](./deployments/velero)

## k3s or K8s

[k3s](https://github.com/rancher/k3s) was my choice in deployment because of how easy and quick it is to get going with [k3sup](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup). I am also using the Docker CRI under k3s instead of the default containerd. This is helpful to me if I ever want to set up Continuous Integration in the future.

## Server Configuration

All my Kubernetes worker and master nodes below are running bare metal Ubuntu 18.04.3. Using a Hypervisor seemed like a bit overkill, all the devices would be running 1 VM anyways.

- 1x OdroidH2 w/ 256GB NVMe and 16GB RAM for the Kubernetes master node
- 3x NUC8i5BEH w/ 1TB NVMe and 32GB RAM for the rook-ceph/storage nodes
- 2x NUC8i7BEH w/ 500GB SSD and 64GB RAM for the worker nodes
- 5x Sonnet Thunderbolt to 10Gb SFP+ for the Intel NUC Kubernetes worker and storage nodes
- 1x Qnap 8 bay NAS w/ 12TB drives for media and some deployment volumes
