# :book:&nbsp; Overview

Welcome to my home Kubernetes cluster. This repo _is_ my Kubernetes cluster in a declarative state. [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux) and [Helm Operator](https://github.com/fluxcd/helm-operator) watch my [deployments](./deployments/) folder and makes the changes to my cluster based on the yaml manifests.

You'll find this is setup for home automation using [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and media automation using [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/), [Radarr](https://radarr.video/) and [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/sign-in/?forwardUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.plex.tv%2F). I also use [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) and [Drone](https://drone.io/) for development automation too. It would take too long to describe all the technologies running so poke around my [deployments](./deployments/) directory to see what's happening. 

Feel free to open a [Github issue](https://github.com/onedr0p/k3s-gitops/issues/new) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/DNCynrJ) if you have any questions.
