All workloads are in the [deployments](./deployments/) folder and sorted into folders by namespace. 

This repository isn't really a tutorial on how to set up a Kubernetes cluster, checkout my [k3s-gitops-arm](https://github.com/onedr0p/k3s-gitops-arm) repo for more of a A-Z guide on how to setup a cluster on some Raspberry Pis.

Huge shout out to [billimek/k8s-gitops](https://github.com/billimek/k8s-gitops) and [carpenike/k8s-gitops](https://github.com/carpenike/k8s-gitops) who continue to be a great resource of information.

## Deployment namespaces

- [cert-manager](./deployments/cert-manager)
- [default](./deployments/default)
- [flux](./deployments/flux)
- [kube-system](./deployments/kube-system)
- [logging](./deployments/logging)
- [monitoring](./deployments/monitoring)
- [rook-ceph](./deployments/rook-ceph)

## k3s or k8s

[k3s](https://github.com/rancher/k3s) was my choice in Kubernetes distros because of how easy and quick it is to get going with [k3sup](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup).

## Server and Hardware configurations

All my Kubernetes master and worker nodes below are running bare metal Ubuntu 18.04.3.
